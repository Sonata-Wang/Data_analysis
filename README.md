# Data_analysis
This Notebook shows how to use Python to perform data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and modeling on a dataset of online retail transactions. It also provides some insights and recommendations based on the analysis. The machine learning classifiers used in this notebook are Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest classification, Extra Trees classification, and Decision Tree classification. These classifiers are applied for fraud detection and late delivery prediction based on accuracy, recall score, and F1 score.
